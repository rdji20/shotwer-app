        Getting a championship is the main goal in basketball and the best
        revenue for the winner of the NBA franchise. From the big picture we can
        see that basketball is easy, you must score more points than your
        opponent and make them score the least amount of points possible in
        order to win. I am not an expert in this field but I have been following
        basketball for a year now and from a soccer player perspective, I can
        see that this sport's individual skills are above the collective ones;
        which means that an above average player's (All Star) individual
        abilities weight more than the collective effort of a team. Due to this
        individualistic approach and having just 5 players per team in the
        court, basketball statistics end up being a really interesting "game
        changer" tool if used correctly. Being a Portland Trailblazers fan, I
        watch week after week how they try way too much 3 pointers, being the
        second team in attempts of three pointers per game with 41.9 attempts. I
        think This is not a bad idea because they have 3 really talented guards
        that can make the three pointer (Dame, CJ, and Powell) and also a power
        forward that can make them too (Roco). The NBA has evolved since the
        outlier team Golden State changed the game in the season 2014-15 for it
        to be a game more skewed towards the three pointer. Teams started to
        build some "small ball" rotations during the game with the goal of
        scoring more three pointers in the absence of a center which is not
        normally a three point shooter. A lot of people including Benjamin
        Morris in his article Stephen Curry is the Revolution are a bit
        skeptical about the three pointer being better than a midrange in the
        long run. They say that once the defenses adjust to the new basketball,
        an equilibrium is going to be reached with mid-range and layups being as
        important as a three point shot. He also talks about how Stephen Curry
        is the best shooter in NBA history and I think that trying to emulate
        what golden state did those seasons is practically impossible but we can
        make an analysis on how probable or improbable this idea can be used by
        Portland to win a championship with one of the best three point shooters
        in the game, Dame Lillard. <br />
        <br />
        The first question that we need to ask is:
        <em>
          Is Damian Lillard close to be as good as Stephen Curry in three point
          shots?
        </em>
        Both of these players are the franchise all star point guards, both of
        them with unlimited three point range, and both of them clutch. After
        some analysis of that Warriors team, staticians and NBA analysts came to
        the conclusion that a big part of Golden State team’s success was thanks
        to the defensive and offensive efforts of Draymond Green, which is
        considered as the top defender in the past decade. His importance in
        basketball is unbelievable that even the web stats magazine,
        FiveThirtyEight, named a defensive statistic in his honor DRAYMOND,
        Defensive Rating Accounting for Yielding Minimal Openness by Nearest
        Defender. This statistic is really important to measure defensive
        attributes by not just taking into account the "easy to measure" data.
        So now that we know that not just Curry’s accuracy was the only
        individual skill that helped to get that championship, we need to ask
        the next question:
        <em>
          Does Portland have a player who can bring defensive awareness the same
          way Draymond did for GS?
        </em>
        Another thing we need to compare between Golden State 14’ is their
        second guard Klay Thompson and our second guard CJ. Klay was paramount
        for the Warriors success, so we need to know if our second guard can be
        as reliable as Thompson.
        <em>
          Is Cj better than Thompson in yielding oponents and making three point
          shots?
        </em>
        <br />
        <br />
        In the beginning I realized that the DRAYMOND had too high and too low
        values, so I had to go back and do a sanity check and see whay was this.
        In the sanity check I found out that DRAYMOND is calculated depending on
        posessions, and there are going to be players that had few amount of
        defending posessions. The type of plays that these type of players have,
        is when the team is losing a by high amount of points and the Team puts
        the bench in (These outlier players being in the second team most of the
        times). Then by checking if Portland has a player that can be a good
        defensive player with average first team posessions, I found out that
        Derrick Jones Jr. has the potential to do so because of his ~ 3 DRAYMOND
        in 2019 with at least 4000 defensive posessions. My fourther analysis on
        Jones Jr. has to be if he can bring Portland the ofensive mindset Green
        had in that Golden State 2014 season as well. <br />
        <br />
        Anlaysing Portland guards, I got a little dissapointed since I thought
        that our guard pair was almost as good as Curry and Thompsons
        partnership. First, Dame hasn't had a season with above .4 in three
        pointer attempts while Stephen has had .4 percentage in all seasons from
        2014 to 2019. Dame started solid this season with almost .48 on 3-pt
        shooting, but as expected by the phenomenon of "regresion to the mean",
        Lillard has been shooting bad percentages from deep for the past 10 or
        more games. Then making a comparisson between CJ and Klay, we can see
        that Klay wins in both categories, 3pt and DRAYMOND. In this analysis we
        can see that we cannot approach the same playing style as Golden State
        had that 2014 season since we don't have the resources to do so.
        Portland team should lower their 3pt shot attempts and instead go for
        the 2pt posession. Also, As much as Damian is our All Star, I think that
        he should get less ofensive 3pt posessions for the upcoming games since,
        backing on stats, we know that his shot is slowly returning to his
        career average, which can damage the team's field goal percentage.
        Instead since the oposition is still going to be defending his 3pt shot,
        he should bring the double-team to him and look for an assist for his
        teammates.
